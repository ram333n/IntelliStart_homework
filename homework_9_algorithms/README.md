# Homework 9 : algorithms
[Tests, benchmark](https://github.com/ram333n/IntelliStart_homework/blob/develop/homework_9_algorithms/src/test/java/org/example/sort/AlgorithmTests.java)
1. Implemented and used quicksort middle pivot algorithm
2. Added comparator in subtask 1 implementation 
3. Used Quicksort to find unique pairs of weight and height
- Additional task : In this task we can't apply comparison-based sorting algorithm for whole algorithm, 
because its average complexity can't be is faster, than Î©(n*log(n)). That's why we need to use non-comparison 
algorithm, for example Bucket sort. The average performance complexity is O(n), but in worst-case(when keys are in close range).
So, the answer is YES(if we talk about average performance)
